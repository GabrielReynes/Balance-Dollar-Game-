# Balance-Dollar-Game-
A Quickly made Unity game to test the AI C# Library

The game idea was inspired by the Numphile video "The Dollar Game" : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U33dsEcKgeQ

The interface is really simple and was only made to train and visualize Agents behavior 
from the AI C# Library that I made : https://github.com/GabrielReynes/Graph-Search-Utilities
